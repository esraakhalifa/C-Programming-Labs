C Programming Labs

Welcome to my C Programming Labs repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains my implementations of various tasks and projects from my C programming course/labs. It covers a wide range of topics in C, showcasing the fundamental to advanced concepts of the language.

ðŸ“– Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of programming exercises and projects written in C. It demonstrates problem-solving skills and understanding of key concepts in C, ranging from simple syntax to intermediate programming paradigms.

ðŸ“š Topics Covered
Here are the key topics and concepts demonstrated in this repository:

Basic Syntax and I/O Operations: Getting started with C, including printf, scanf, and command-line arguments.
Control Flow: Conditional statements (if, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).
Functions: Implementation of user-defined functions, recursion, and function pointers.
Arrays and Strings: Operations on arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and string manipulation.
Pointers: Pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free), and pointer-to-pointer.
Structures and Unions: Structs, unions, and enumerations to organize data.
Custom Implementations: Reimplementing standard library functions like strcpy, strcat, etc.
